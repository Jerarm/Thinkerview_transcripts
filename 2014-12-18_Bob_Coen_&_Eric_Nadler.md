0010.74-0035.12   Three, two, one, go.
0059.76-0089.33   Hello gentlemen, I would like to interview you today for a YouTube channel called Sincorio. I would have liked to have small answers on your latest film about chemical weapons. What is it called?
0089.39-0116.24   The film is called Amchimik Under the Sea. And how long ago did you make it? We made it last year and it was broadcast on the Arte channel in February 2014. So this film deals with the world's arsenals buried under the sea, in the lakes, all over Europe. What was the most polluted place you could visit?
0116.24-0143.66   What was polluted? In the Baltics, it was mostly mustard gas.
0143.66-0164.54   What is the risk of this sinking under the sea? What are the risks? The risks are mainly for fishermen, for fish and for the environment.
0164.54-0194.18   from the sea, all the organizations that are there. The researchers you met who were investigating on this subject gave you a critical time. The problem is that most of these weapons were thrown after the Second World War. There are weapons that were thrown before that, during the First World War, but most were thrown after the Second World War and they were thrown in
0194.18-0223.38   in French it's barrels, metal barrels. And these barrels have a life due to corrosion of more or less 50 years. That is to say that we are now... We arrive at the charnier period. This is the critical moment where these barrels are opening up and these chemical weapons are...
0223.38-0240.78   Did you investigate a little bit on the coast, on the Mediterranean Sea, the Côte d'Azur? Yes, especially here in France, on the Côte d'Azur, there are areas, even today, we see signs where we can't swim.
0240.78-0267.44   but we don't know why, but it's because of the archivists who were thrown there. And above all, we didn't film in France, but we filmed a lot in Italy, the Adriatic coast, which is really another very polluted coast after the Baltic. We can say that Italy has a lot of archivists who are in the Adriatic Ocean.
0267.47-0292.46   Did you meet the population? Did you discuss with the population about the risks they could face? Most of the population is not aware of this problem. Because it is a very, very secret subject. No one has talked about it. We can say that this film is the first time it has been discussed.
0292.46-0300.70   There have been investigations done by journalists, especially in Italy, a journalist who wrote a book.
0300.70-0330.24   I don't know how many years, but it's quite recent, five years ago. But it's a new subject. And when we talked about it, when we talked to people that we were filming by the sea, either in the Baltic or in Italy, and we met people and asked them, what are you doing? We asked them, do you know that there are chemical weapons? Everyone was very shocked. I think the population doesn't know.
0330.24-0358.38   and it's a subject that scares a lot. You were chosen to be the director of this documentary because you were also the director of a film called Anthrax War. Can you tell us a few words about this film? Yes, the film Anthrax War was a film that looked at the biological situation at the moment, the research that is happening.
0358.42-0386.05   and the development of biological weapons. And really, it's a film that started after the attacks of anthrax, just after September 11, in the United States, letters containing anthrax were sent to the media and to some American senators in Washington. And you investigated the strains of this anthrax?
0386.05-0406.69   Yes, one of the things we did in this film was to look at the sources of this anthrax to know where it came from and to do a forensic investigation. So what did you put forward on these sources?
0406.69-0426.38   If we look at the anthrax, it is what we call weaponized anthrax. It is a militarized anthrax that was very sophisticated, that was worked on.
0459.70-0481.62   And the conclusion? That it was a subject that was really worked on, that it had to come from a state project, that it was not possible for one person or even a small group of people to...
0481.74-0507.87   develop a similar approach without great means. In your opinion, do you think that this was a way in which the state had intimidated certain institutions to legitimize some anti-terrorist laws against the spread of biological weapons? We can't know the reasons, but we can't really speculate, but it's sure that...
0507.87-0531.58   What happened is that these attacks launched a lot of new research on biological weapons and a lot of very large expenses and large budgets that were made on that. But we also know that biological weapons, we don't talk about it much, but that all states
0531.58-0560.62   are working on it. Bob Cohen, you are a war reporter, you have made some passages during some conflicts such as Morovia at the time. What determined you or what predestined you to investigate this type of biological weapons scandal? For me it came from growing up in Africa. Zimbabwe? In Zimbabwe. At the time it was the English colony of Rhodesia.
0560.62-0588.43   We had experienced a very violent war of independence. I grew up in the society of colonists. I was a little colonist, I grew up like a little colonist. When I reached middle age, the war was in full force there. Many of my school friends went to war. I didn't do it, I ran away.
0588.72-0616.98   After I became a journalist, I learned that the Rhodesian forces, the white government army, used biological weapons and chemical weapons. And above all, they used anthrax. We can say that Zimbabwe had the largest anthrax epidemic in the year...
0617.14-0641.65   in 1998, which killed more than 300 people and infected more than 10,000. I found myself in New York in 2001, just at the time of the attack on Antrax, and I wondered if there was a link.
0641.65-0670.64   between what happened in my country of Zimbabwe and what happened in the United States. And that's what started the film. What are the consequences of this type of reasoning? Yes, it was a question. It was interesting to see if there was a link. One last question for you, Bob. What is the worst conflict you have had to face in your career as a war reporter? All conflicts are...
0672.08-0696.86   are bad, are terrible. War is something awful to experience. But we can say that maybe Liberia was particularly, we can say, a little crazy, because they were young men, young people who were drugged with weapons.
0696.86-0724.59   a lot of confusion, a lot of disorder, and a lot of danger. Please introduce your friend Eric. So, let me introduce my associate Eric Nagler. We worked together on the two films, The Chemical Weapons Under the Sea, and our film Attracts War, which we also did together. And we've been working together for ten years. What is your background, Eric?
0724.59-0754.42   I've been a reporter for newspapers, writer for magazines, author of books, and I began making documentary films about 25 years ago. What drew me to this topic is I've had an interest for many years in weapons of mass destruction. Around 2000, the year 2000, I made a film called Stealing the Fire, which dealt with the nuclear weapons underground.
0754.42-0779.46   And we had exclusive access to the first man accused of nuclear espionage since Klaus Fuchs back in the 50s. He was a German. He had access to uranium enrichment technology for a firm where he worked. And he took those plans and he sold them to Iraqi agents for Saddam Hussein.
0779.46-0804.91   And there was a worldwide manhunt on for him after those plans were found in a chicken coop that the United Nations inspectors were sent to by Hussein's brother-in-law. And as soon as they saw the plans, they knew that this man, Karlheim Schab, had taken them. And he was hiding in Brazil.
0804.91-0832.40   And because he didn't think there'd be an extradition treaty, he also was helping the Brazilians with their secret nuclear program, helping them to develop a nuclear submarine, among other things. But eventually the Brazilians extradited him to Germany. He stood trial. He was accused of treason and nuclear espionage. He was found guilty and he was fined 32,000 euros and given a suspended sentence. He's a free man today.
0832.40-0847.15   And this was my first film on weapons of mass destruction. And then Bob and I got together on biological weapons. And then we just did chemical weapons. So we've done all the big ones. And maybe that's behind us now. I don't know.
0847.15-0875.66   Okay, I would like your point of view about the war in Iraq. So they talk about the weapon of mass destruction, the arsenal of Saddam Hussein was huge, and they legitimate the war with this pretext. So what is your point of view about that? My point of view is the facts uncovered is at some point in the 1990s, he had a nuclear program, as many countries do, he gave it up.
0875.66-0900.67   and there was no real information that he had revived it again. He certainly had the software, the plans that he obtained from Schaub for uranium technology, very, very, very sophisticated stuff. Once he had that, who knows what he could do with it. He could sell it, whatever.
0900.67-0929.36   But the pretext that he had biological weapons, that he had nuclear weapons, was never proven. So the basic justification for that war, I think, was an illegitimate one, ultimately. I think they cooked the books. The Americans cooked the books, skewed the data, leaked it to the media, created a frenzy. And to this day, they haven't found any proof that his program continued in a sophisticated manner.
0929.36-0958.27   despite some moves back in the 90s. In fact, Muammar Gaddafi had a sophisticated program as well. He gave up the program and was one of the few countries to actually give up a program. I don't know if that was wise or not because they eventually ousted him and killed him. And so I don't know what sign that sends to the Mullahs in Iran what you do with your weapons. But as far as the Iraq war goes, I think it was illegitimate. I think it was...
0958.27-0967.89   done some sort of revenge for 9-11, but Hussein had nothing to do with 9-11. So I think it's been a tragedy for the region and the world.
0967.89-0996.42   What was your reaction when you saw Colin Powell, who is a little bit on front tracks, who shaked on tracks in front of a lot of diplomatic persons? Well, this is before I had done serious research into this topic for the film. This is when I was just an American citizen, and I was alarmed. In other words, if the American intelligence people had convinced Colin Powell, who...
0996.42-1025.17   It was kind of a career soldier, not a real spooky guy, to stand up in front of the world and say that he was producing this. Well, I was concerned, but as we know now, the evidence was not there, and the speech he gave was false. And so, in retrospect, I'm angry about that, but at the time, I viewed it like most citizens, and I was concerned. Bob, when you saw Colin Powell shake a little in Trax,
1025.17-1047.12   What was your reaction at the time and what is your reaction now? It was a very, very important point for everything that was... The return to war. Yes, the return to war. It was very important. And in the film Attracts War, it's also a very important point because...
1048.05-1076.43   Through the search for the history of what happened in the biological areas, we also inquired about the deaths of researchers, several researchers, and the most famous was David Kelly, who was the one who had said, because when Colin Powell took this anthrax, it was information that they had from the English, the Americans.
1076.59-1101.20   And in fact, David Kelly had spoken against it and had said that the file had been sexed up, that is to say, fabricated. And it is because of this that the BBC, in fact, there was a great scandal because he had said that...
1101.36-1131.06   unofficially, anonymously, but the BBC at the time, we gave his name, we said it was him who had said that, and it caused a very, very big scandal in England, which almost forced Tony Blair to resign because of that, and which in fact caused the death in one way or another of
1131.06-1157.39   of David Carey. It was said that he committed suicide a few days after he was in front of the English Parliament to answer questions on the subject. And it was a very suspicious suicide in many ways. So, without a doubt, it was a very, very important moment for...
1157.42-1184.59   for the great powers to enter Iraq. And as we know now, in September, in Iraq, we are experiencing the consequences until today. I will ask you two one last question and then one last question. We are lucky to have two Americans in front of the camera. I would like to have your perception on the concept of war against terrorism.
1184.59-1210.75   Eric, I would like your point of view about the concept of war on terror. What is your point of view about that? It's a shadowy business, this international war on terror. It's hard to understand what groups are out there, who's doing what, who's behind it, who benefits from the chaos that this war on terror causes.
1210.75-1240.53   I know a few things that have been done in the name of the war on terror that frighten me as a citizen. Basically, in terms of the United States and the passing of the Patriot Act, civil liberties are threatened. In fact, in the recent revelations of Edward Snowden, we see that the national security state is an international surveillance state. George Orwell's 1984 has come true in the guise of the war on terror.
1241.49-1266.48   It raises the question whether safety or liberty or freedom can be traded off in a way that benefits many citizens. So I think a lot is done by the state in terms of the war on terror that goes beyond things they've ever done before. And when you go to the roots of who's actually the terrorists out there, there's a few, I don't know, a hundred.
1266.54-1293.07   thousand people, a handful of people are causing these problems and the films we're doing lately look into these shadowy wars. We're really not sure who the players are, who they're working for. So it raises a lot of questions. The war on terror makes me uneasy, A, because if there are two terrorists out there doing terrible things, that's a horrible thing, but if somehow
1293.07-1322.10   governments are manipulating the situation to increase their powers, that's also troubling. So I'm really troubled by the entire scenario of the post-911 world. I live in New York City. I edited a film downtown Manhattan. Every night I looked out and I saw the smoldering ruins of the World Trade Center. And the world that my children grew up in is different than the world I grew up in, and it's not a better place.
1322.22-1349.23   I'm troubled by the world we live in now.
1349.23-1376.56   And who are the real terrorists? What is terrorism in fact? But also we must look that after the Cold War, we always needed a villain, an enemy, someone to be afraid of, to first control people, but above all there is also the economic aspect.
1376.56-1404.67   huge budgets, militarization of the armies, under the name of the war against terrorism. So there are a lot of questions that we ask ourselves. And we can say that since the war against terrorism started after September 11, the world has changed completely.
1404.67-1429.30   I have a question. I would like advice for the young generation. What is your advice, Eric? Question authority. As always, I tell my son, don't believe what you read in the papers. Don't believe what your government says. Think for yourself. And basically...
1429.33-1454.96   organize around issues that are important to you. I think the hold of the powers that be, at least in the United States, I think basically the government is run by a military industrial complex that supersedes Republicans or Democrats, that has come to believe that war is a very profitable venture. We're living in a time of eternal war.
1454.96-1481.33   And basically I think you have to make the government accountable for all its claims. So basically question authority and do not be afraid to engage in civil disobedience when you don't believe the government's doing the right thing.
1481.55-1509.68   To not trust what we say, what we read, what we see in the television. But I think that young people already know that. I think that the generation already knows that. And not to be afraid, and also not to educate oneself, to try to seek answers, to ask questions. And above all, not to be afraid. We must not be afraid, we must have courage.
1509.84-1538.46   And it's really up to them to change. We are our generation, we have caused a lot of problems, but we will leave a lot of problems for the young. And it's really up to them, it's in their hands to change and also to use the technology they have in an intelligent way. Because the technology of the internet and all the information they have at the fingertips
1538.46-1560.05   It can be used in a negative way for the control that we have seen, but it can also be used in a very very powerful way to change. To spread an epidemic of good through technology. Exactly. Thank you very much gentlemen. I wish you a very good day. My pleasure.
1567.70-1593.73   From the moment we allow operators to do what they want on the network, we allow them to change society. We allow them to change the way people interact. There are more and more opportunities, more and more knowledge and talent, and more and more solutions. And more and more capital for projects. That is to say that what is missing at the moment...
1593.73-1605.11   that in many countries we are evolving the institutional framework to include civil society in the debate. And we are very far from doing that in France. I think it's even a bit the terror of institutions.
