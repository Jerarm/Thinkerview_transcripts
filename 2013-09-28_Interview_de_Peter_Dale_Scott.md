0010.42-0038.22   I think American policies are usually dictated by amazing ignorance. In the case of Libya, for example, I think that the Americans who got involved, and the French... Bonjour Thinkerview, je vous salue de Berkeley en Californie.
0046.26-0061.95   I see that in principle, in theory, America thinks it has a free economy and that it is regulated by the open market. But in reality, as everyone knows,
0061.95-0086.62   The dollar is very weak because America imports much more than exports, and this system is not very strong. We saw crises recently, especially in 2007-2008.
0086.62-0109.90   And in this crisis, the banks, not only in the United States, but the world banks, have had a crisis, a lack of capital, which has been raised by illegal funds and black funds, as we say in English, drug trafficking.
0109.90-0137.50   On ne sait pas la grandeur du trafic de drogue mais on a fait une estimation que peut-être il y a eu milliards de dollars par an qui sont blanchis dans les banques et il y a eu un officier des Nations Unies
0137.50-0152.98   who said there were banks that would have failed during this crisis if there had not been this remedy of illegal funds in drug trafficking.
0157.90-0175.92   There are two ways to see the role of the war against drugs. For me, the main fact, the most important, is that the price of drugs is much higher than it would be...
0175.92-0203.89   if there wasn't this war against drugs. That means that the great kings of drugs, they approve this war against drugs because it's the source of their profit. And drugs become like a tax on ordinary people who enrich the rich and their funds.
0203.89-0231.39   Finally, they arrive in the American banks. The banks make specific arrangements to receive these private funds. There is the ordinary bank, and then next to the private bank, which receives illegal fortunes, such as that of, for example, the brother of the president of Mexico.
0231.39-0252.46   The result is that drugs are even more important in the economy than it would be if we didn't have this war against drugs.
0259.76-0262.14   Yes, it's true that...
0262.14-0289.90   for the states. When I talk, for example, about California, our first agronomic product is marijuana. But it's true that there is no tax on marijuana because it's not legal. It's starting to change a little bit, but in principle, it's illegal, it's not taxed.
0289.90-0317.46   and the government suffers. The economy is different, because even if we talk now about the heroin that comes from Afghanistan, the big profits are not made in Afghanistan, the country of production, they are in the country of consumption, because we estimate that maybe 80...
0317.46-0347.28   or more, 80% of the profit is made in these countries, and even the other profits are also banked in a country where the banks are firm and guaranteed, that is to say the United States.
0347.28-0374.50   two moments when the United States intervened in Afghanistan. The first was against the Russians, the Soviets, in 1979, and the second, of course, after September 11, 2001. The result of these two interventions is that Afghanistan, which has always had
0374.50-0402.66   of opium and hashish, of marijuana. But before the first American intervention, there was no power in the international market. Consumption was local. And even the Americans went to have a summer of drugs without...
0402.66-0420.14   without danger in the 70s. It was what we called the hippie trail. But almost nothing in 1979.
0420.14-0446.46   Until now, almost 90% of the international heroin comes from Afghanistan. And even in the United States, if I can add another figure, the percentage of heroin in the United States that came from what we call the gold croissant was zero.
0446.46-0468.19   In 1979. And according to the government, in 1980, it jumped to 60%. We see that in Washington,
0468.19-0492.88   And there is this big problem of drugs, and there are sociologists, doctors, all sorts of experts who say that it is really necessary to change the law, and especially to start legalizing marijuana, but it is an forbidden subject in Washington.
0492.88-0520.96   If you want to pursue a political career, you must not get involved in this problem. And the reason, I think, is because there is too much money, too much profit that comes from the current situation. And that's why it's one example, not the only one, where our democracy doesn't work.
0520.96-0545.26   Because money forbids the discussion of real problems, including drugs, which is really one of the big problems that ruins life in the big cities, the inner city, as we say in English, for 50 years.
0545.26-0570.29   We have expected a change in the laws, but it is forbidden as a subject. Is it because politicians are not free? Yes, they are free to discuss it if they want, but they know very well that it will be the end of their career. So for that, they do not discuss it.
0581.90-0599.73   Dans ma vie, je n'ai passé que six mois à Washington. Je connais Washington très mal. Mais j'ai vu un exemple au Congrès de...
0599.79-0624.85   of the way in which we are not allowed to talk about drugs. I was part of a secret commission, that is to say, we received speeches in a private chamber for one of the committees of the chamber of the Congress.
0625.04-0643.39   The president of this commission said at the beginning that there was a word that he absolutely did not want to hear in the discussion, and that word was legalization.
0643.39-0668.00   And I wondered why. But later I did some research. I found that this representative in the room had a brother with a... What do you call it? They have a word.
0668.00-0686.00   He was a lawyer. In his lawyer's office, he had a very large client. He was one of the greatest kings of drugs in the city of New York. So he was a source of profit.
0686.00-0706.26   which would have been damaged if the drug had been legalized. And that's why, I think, for this individual, but who was a rather important individual, by the way, who did not want to hear the word legalization.
0712.82-0726.10   C'est vrai aussi qu'il y a des grandes bureaucraties, comme le DIA, qui est chargé d'empêcher la drogue et toutes les prisons.
0726.10-0753.41   And all these bureaucracies become a part of the system that governs the country. They don't want to see a change. It was like in the 1920s in the United States with the prohibition. More and more, it was obvious that we had to change. But at that time, there was also a great resistance that came from bureaucracy and elsewhere.
0753.41-0781.65   When we finally legalized alcohol, it was the moment when we increased the pursuit of drugs. And the people who used to look for the boxes of alcohol, now they are looking for marijuana for the first time. It was immediately after the end of the prohibition of alcohol.
0786.99-0810.64   I have a weakness. It's that I invent words from time to time, like deep politics. And I also invented this phrase, a supra-world. In English, there is an underworld, a sub-world, which makes a power over the government from below.
0810.64-0828.51   but it is much weaker than the powers under the government from above. And I call all these private forces, corporations, but also individuals, the very rich, the very rich who take care of politics.
0828.51-0850.19   I call them the supra-world. And in my book, here, The Road to World Disorder, I even gave a definition that I'm going to read. And for that, I'll need my glasses for a moment. Supra-world.
0851.63-0878.59   Le royaume de la société riche et privilégiée qui est le théâtre d'une influence efficace exercée sur le gouvernement par le pouvoir privé, bien que le supramonde ne soit pas institutionnalisé ni autorisé formellement à exercer une telle influence. Il inclut
0878.59-0899.92   First of all, those whose influence is exercised through their wealth, that they are personally or more traditionally administered by the tax-exonerated foundations and the projects they support, and secondly, the representatives of the first.
0899.98-0926.77   This term must be distinguished from that of Frederick Lundberg, the super-rich, that is to say the 60 richest families in the United States, which he predicted in an erroneous way in 1967 in his work Sixty Families that it would continue to dominate the United States as much as the class and government of money.
0926.96-0940.69   The recent annual rankings established by the Forbes magazine among the 400 richest Americans show that Lundberg was wrong.
0940.94-0963.82   On two fronts, the richest heirs of 1967 are not necessarily the richest of today, and the richest of today are not necessarily those who project their wealth into political power.
0963.82-0985.10   By the way, the super-world is not a class, but a category. This is very important. We must not think that this class unifies the rich. The rich know each other, but they do not act in a solidary way.
0991.76-1009.20   It was ironic to conceive as an institutional rule the influence of the super-world as it was exercised through the Bilderberg Society, the Trilateral Commission or the Foreign Relations Council.
1009.20-1028.11   However, there are less known and usually secret cabals that prosper within these super-world environments. For example, in France, the Cirque du Pinet or the Safari Club. That's my definition.
1036.11-1061.12   It is true that they are organized. It is true that there is, for example, Davos every year. There is the Bilderberg Society. There is the Trilateral Commission. And the fact of all these different organizations indicates that it is a rather pluralist situation than unified.
1061.12-1089.90   But in the middle, you really have to realize that, for example, not everyone knows it, but it's true that in 1974, I think, the Wilson government in England was upset, put to the door, and also De Gaulle, at the end of his power, had problems with his intelligence service.
1089.90-1111.10   And we later learned that there was a small circle that was proud of the fact that it had been able to elect Mrs. Thatcher in England.
1111.10-1126.75   So, there is not even an organization, but even profound powers in the middle of this super-world, because the force of money is very, very strong. For example...
1126.75-1154.22   We know very well that there were two increases in oil prices, the first in 1972-13 and the second in 1979-80. We know that Nixon was responsible for the first because it helped his projects.
1154.22-1174.83   to settle the region of the Iranian Gulf, because the profits for Iran, Saudi Arabia, which came from the increase in oil,
1174.83-1202.30   paid for their importation of American weapons with teams to teach the use of these weapons and all that. The second, of course, under the presidency of President Carter, it did not help his policy at all. On the contrary, it was responsible for his fall.
1202.30-1223.84   But I think that the Republicans had contacts in the oil countries, and maybe BP in particular, encouraged OPEC to raise the price of oil, and in this way...
1223.84-1239.94   We saw the almost simultaneous election of Thatcher in England, and then also Reagan in the United States, and really the election of President Reagan.
1239.94-1269.36   was the beginning of a new era in the United States where there was a great increase in subsidies for military budgets and for the secret budget of the CIA. The CIA started a war in Afghanistan and all that. And we see a result in civil society that
1269.36-1298.67   Avant 1980, les classes riches et pauvres s'approchaient dans le revenu. Il y avait une diminution de la disparité entre les riches et les pauvres. Mais depuis cette année-là, depuis 1980, c'est le contraire. Que maintenant, les riches deviennent beaucoup plus riches et les pauvres beaucoup plus pauvres. Et nous sommes pire maintenant.
1298.67-1311.60   Europe in this statistic. That is to say, before 1980, England was...
1311.60-1332.82   a class country with rich and poor, and the United States less. Now it's the opposite. America is more divided between the rich and the poor than England or almost any other country in Europe, except Russia.
1348.43-1373.44   When I talk about the supra-world, you don't have to think that the supra-world is divided by a big, big government pit. No, it's the source of people, especially in the past, people came in from the supra-world, they came into the government, and especially in the position of...
1373.44-1402.50   the Secretary of Finance, the Treasury Secretary. But there was also an institution in the middle of the government that received much more thought and direction from Wall Street than the rest of the government, and that was the CIA.
1402.50-1420.93   The CIA that was created was really a creation of Wall Street. Truman was the president and he was not very comfortable with the idea of having a service of intelligence in a state of peace.
1420.93-1442.77   But it was Wall Street who insisted, it was Wall Street who won. And it's very interesting to see that Truman insisted that the leader of his time, the leader was never Wall Street, always Central America, especially the army.
1447.54-1475.47   Before Alan Dulles, who was obviously pure Wall Street, there was never a boss who came from Wall Street. But the sub-bosses, all the sub-bosses that we know, I know seven, they were all from Wall Street. And in addition, there is what we call the Society Register, which means...
1475.47-1498.70   rich people who inherited the great society of New York. Six of these seven were from this society, this social register. So from the beginning, it was a creation of Wall Street. And finally,
1499.47-1524.54   For technical reasons, which I talk about in my book, American War Machine, it was Truman who introduced Allen Dulles as one of his sub-chefs in the CIA. But the moment the Republicans finally won the presidency in 1952,
1524.54-1551.66   C'était la fin des chefs de l'armée, c'est General Beedle Smith, et c'est le commencement de l'époque de Dulles, un Dulles qui était au CIA, et un autre Dulles, son frère, qui était le secrétaire d'État. Et nous avons vu à cette époque une politique pure de Wall Street, commençant avec...
1551.66-1577.94   assistance to raise the elected president in Iran, Mr. Mossadegh, to save the Anglo-Iranian oil company, which is now called BP. And secondly, right after, in Guatemala, to save United Fruit.
1577.94-1589.46   against another elected president, Arbenz, elected in a democratic way.
1602.10-1628.46   You have to remember that Truman, while creating this CIA, he thought it would be a service of intelligence, of intelligence, of finding news from all over the country. But from the beginning, under the direction of the people of Wall Street,
1628.46-1654.91   They entered into the operations, that is to say, criminal operations in general, in the rest of the world, because it was partly because of the Soviet threat at the time. The first operation was to put money in the 1948 Italian election.
1654.91-1681.50   And they said that the Russians did the same thing, so they had to do the same thing. But in the 1950s, all the CIA operations, the big operations, they were for the good of Wall Street. And we don't know that because the CIA...
1681.50-1697.17   and also mixed in Southeast Asia, starting first in Thailand, then in Burma, then in Laos, and finally, in a much larger way, in Vietnam.
1707.18-1728.77   I would say that from the beginning, the interventions of the CIA were for the purposes first defined by Wall Street. At this moment, we are talking about the Foreign Relations Council, the Council of Foreign Relations.
1728.77-1753.74   that there was a discussion about what we should do in Guatemala before the CIA started. So, first of all, a discussion in New York, a decision, and then a decision communicated in Washington. It was under Eisenhower who was very willing and he was in agreement.
1753.74-1778.51   But the way to influence politics was mainly through the CIA, and it was executed by the CIA. And I see the same thing later with Vietnam, because Vietnam was, for me, the real reason.
1778.51-1805.12   to intervene in Vietnam. It was because with the technical developments of oil research, for the first time, we could find oil under the sea. And we knew from the beginning of the 1950s that there was a lot of oil.
1805.12-1825.26   under the Chinese sea, the sea between Vietnam and Indonesia. And we see at this time large interventions of the CIA in Vietnam and Indonesia. And after that...
1825.26-1850.72   the signing of contracts with American companies to develop oil under the sea, in Vietnam, in Cambodia, in Thailand, and especially in Indonesia. I really started my research looking for the reason why the Americans intervened.
1850.72-1872.14   Indonesian politics in 1965, with the result of a great massacre of perhaps a million people, civilians, women, children, a whole class of institutions in schools, because they were in a...
1872.14-1893.04   a communist party, but a rather pacifist party, which wanted to win an election. That was one of the great interventions of the United States, not only the CIA, but also the American army, with all sorts of things. But it was for oil.
1912.43-1934.03   The rhetoric at the time was to talk about the natural resources of the region. We talked about rubber, we talked about tin, all that. It wasn't wrong. It counted. Especially one of the biggest, less discussed but very important, was the...
1934.03-1951.81   Wulfram? Tungsten? I don't know the word in French. I hope it's Tungsten. It's Tungsten in English. And it's absolutely necessary for a strong steel for armaments in armored tanks, etc.
1951.81-1981.01   It was absolutely necessary and it came from that time in China, which is now out of the question, and also from Southeast Asia. That was also true, but I think the oil exceeded the others, especially the caoutchouc, because now most of our caoutchouc comes from oil. It's artificial.
1981.01-2010.06   And we see in the statistics the trade between Southeast Asia and America was based on oil. The investments that we saw in Southeast Asia, a large part also from Japan, but Japan's economy after the war was a creation of the Americans.
2018.99-2044.99   Because we think at this time that American politics was defined by the Cold War against Russia, against the Soviet Union, we wonder in what part this Cold War was true and in what part it was a kind of mask.
2044.99-2072.99   for the more capitalist reasons of Wall Street. In my opinion, personally, I thought about it a lot because I was young at that time, but I remember it well, is that, in part, the fear of the Soviet Union was real and was true. That is to say that...
2072.99-2100.03   I don't think the Soviet Union would ever invade Western Europe with its divisions in Eastern Europe. And that's the great myth of NATO. And when I was in government, I started questioning this myth. I didn't believe it at the time and I don't believe it now. But...
2100.03-2126.94   I think it is very, very possible that the communist parties in Italy and in France would have won their elections. And it is because the CIA intervened to prevent this result that we now see a non-communist Europe. And from my personal point of view,
2126.94-2151.15   Je n'aime pas les moyens qui ont été utilisés pour protéger l'Europe de l'Ouest, mais je suis très content que nous voyons pas une France qui a subi la même politique après la guerre que, par exemple, la Pologne.
2151.15-2162.99   because I lived in Poland. It wasn't that bad. I knew people in the socialist government, they were my friends, but...
2162.99-2190.98   It was sad for Poland, and I am happy that Poland is now free of the Russian influence. And for me personally, I believe that the events in France would have been as sad if the communists had been put in power. These are very difficult subjects to discuss, but...
2190.98-2205.10   I said all this to admit that there was an element of truth at the beginning in the Cold War. But also, we have to see that
2205.10-2226.64   When this war developed, it was increasingly influenced by the private interests of the supra-world, and I will now also include the large international corporations of the time, which were above all.
2226.64-2251.15   Oil corporations like Standard Oil, Exxon, Mobil, Texaco. The Cold War changed over the years to become a way to protect the interests of these large corporations. No.
2251.15-2276.93   not necessarily in Europe, but partly in Europe, with the Truman Doctrine to guarantee a non-communist Greece. It was admitted at that time, it was admitted that it was to guarantee that the oil of Saudi Arabia could be sold in Europe.
2276.93-2300.35   because the big corporations didn't want it to come from the United States because they still had domestic production here in the United States. This oil had to go to Europe and for that, it had to have a non-communist Greece. That was a beginning.
2300.35-2313.46   of a mix between the real Cold War and the interests of the corporations. But later, it was almost purely corporations.
2318.99-2341.82   Yes, I just wrote a small article on the current situation in the middle of 2013 in Syria, because it is a choice that has been reproduced many times in American history, a choice between a military policy
2341.82-2368.70   and a diplomatic policy. It was at the beginning of May that the United States and Russia agreed that it was necessary to convene a convention, perhaps in Geneva, to look for an international diplomatic solution.
2368.70-2397.95   to the Syrian problem that was becoming more and more serious and that threatened to grow and to go beyond the Syrian borders and to create a crisis in Lebanon, in Iraq, and even maybe in Turkey, because there are Kurds everywhere.
2397.95-2426.48   I was very disappointed that finally Obama, who had taken a very narrow position, he did not want to meddle in this affair, but finally under the pressure of the fake camps in Washington, he agreed to send weapons, small weapons, but weapons to the fighters.
2426.48-2451.73   And it was a joke, because the CIA had already sent not only weapons, but also specialists to teach in weapons. It was a bit like Libya. There was a secret policy that already started this policy.
2451.73-2477.90   This is very dangerous for an international diplomatic solution. Hope is not completely gone, but it is much weaker now. The problem is that in Syria, as in the other countries I spoke about, there is a problem with oil. Now it is more and more the gas.
2477.90-2494.99   Before it was oil, now it's more and more gas. We discovered gas even in Syria. But what is much more important is...
2495.22-2522.61   a gas field. It's a region of gas underground. It's under the Gulf, which is divided in half for Qatar and half for Iran. And it's the largest region in the world. The market for this gas is Europe.
2522.61-2545.78   And the gas trucks will not go through Israel, they will go through Syria, as usual. There was the first oil truck, from Saudi Arabia, going through Iraq and finally from Syria to the Mediterranean.
2545.78-2555.81   It was over a long time ago. There was another train that was damaged during the Iraq war. But now it's a choice.
2555.81-2582.69   Qatar said to Mr. Assad in Syria, you have to resign. We want a more Muslim government that would let our gas pipeline go from Iraq to Turkey because there is now a large gas pipeline that will build the Nabucco line.
2582.69-2608.19   in Turkey, and Qatar wanted to sell its gas to this line. But at the same time, simultaneously, Iran said, we will also take gas from this same region and send it to Europe by a train that would pass Iran.
2608.19-2635.76   and Iraq, because now Iraq is much closer to Iran than before, and finally, Syria. And this war between the government on one side and the different parties between the rebels
2635.76-2660.80   The reason is that it was subsidized especially by Qatar, which had already paid, I believe, more than $3 billion in subsidies for this revolt, because they wanted to have Assad at their doorstep to have them led.
2660.80-2673.66   Assad is protected now. He begins to win with the support of Hezbollah, which is directly subsidized and partly led by...
2673.66-2698.08   Tehran in Iran, and Assad signed an official contract with Iran to have a gas pipeline that would pass directly. We call it, I think, the Islamic gas pipeline that will pass through Iran.
2698.08-2715.50   There is now a port that used to be a fairly small port, but which will surely become much larger because of gas, even there, even in Syria.
2715.50-2744.48   Like most of the US intervention and CIA, everywhere, and especially in Libya and Iraq, it was about oil, gas, and Syria is not an exception, but it's rather... it was like Afghanistan, because the moment the United States
2744.48-2751.97   with the Taliban at the end of the 1980s.
2751.97-2776.59   We were talking about an oil pipeline that would pass from Kazakhstan to Pakistan through Afghanistan. That's why UNOCAL, an American company, invited the representatives of the Taliban to come to Texas to be trained in technical affairs.
2776.59-2787.60   It's always the oil, when we talk about America and its dollar oil that is the basis of its international fortune.
2798.00-2827.39   America is divided between the Foucaults and the Colombians on the Syria theme. But in Europe, it's the same situation, but there is an even more serious division because there are two kinds of interests in Europe. Small countries like Austria in the east, they want to have
2827.39-2837.33   of gas as soon as possible. They don't want to be under...
2837.33-2864.75   the too deep influence of Russia. So they invite France, on the contrary, which had historical interests in the region. And Austria is perhaps one of the columns of Europe, and France is currently one of the falcons of Europe.
2864.75-2884.19   as it was also in the case of Libya. It was Bernard Lévy who, in a sense, started all the problems in Libya in 2011. That's why these problems...
2884.19-2905.46   of gas and oil are not simple. They create regional alliances and, above all, Russia has a rather complicated position through this oil pipeline. Because I imagine that Russia...
2905.46-2926.99   preferred to have neither the Qatar driver nor the Iran driver, because the gas market is not infinite, it is limited, and currently it is Russian gas.
2935.92-2965.30   To finish, I would like to say something to the young people who are attending this interview. I would like to talk about the reason why I do my research and my investigations. First of all, I come from Canada, which is a rather small country if we talk about the number of people.
2965.30-2994.00   in Canada, the impression that if we have an idea to improve the country, we can share it with the leaders in Ottawa, with the members of the Canadian parliament. And even in truth, I did it a little bit when I was young, even before the age of 20. And when I arrived in the United States, I had the same illusion.
2994.00-3012.22   But you know very well that it's not the same thing in the United States. There are more people in California alone, I think, than in the whole of Canada. So it's on a completely different scale. And I must say that...
3012.22-3038.40   If I had the idea at the beginning, I fought against intervention in the Vietnam War. From my career in diplomacy, I knew a little bit of the Vietnamese situation, not much, but enough to convince me that the United States should not enter this war.
3038.40-3067.44   for the American health as much as the Vietnamese health. And I learned that a whole movement of thousands, almost millions at the end, they assisted a little bit to end this war. But my personal contribution was very, very small.
3067.44-3096.21   And I don't have the impression that my ideas will change the United States. Not at all. But still, I'm very happy to do what I do. I meet people that I love. I'm in a room here with two friends that I met in a movement. And in these movements, I meet people that I love.
3096.21-3107.60   And also, I always have the idea that even if I don't contribute to the politics of the present...
3107.60-3132.43   that there is always the politics of the future and that maybe I can persuade other people to be like me, interested in international justice, in personal freedom and in democracy. On the screen, the level of Washington
3132.43-3147.15   It's a very bad moment now for justice, freedom, democracy. But still, I see that...
3147.38-3175.66   The bad policy of Washington creates an opposition, and I absolutely want to be part of this opposition because I have faith in the human race that we finally have a tendency towards democracy, towards freedom.
3175.66-3203.71   and towards the joy of being free in a free and open society. And I would be very disappointed if I did not think that I could contribute a little bit to this future. And I want, I hope that among you, you, the youth,
3203.71-3219.50   there will be people who will have the same hope to participate in the future of our country, of our globe and our human race. Thank you very much.
3230.06-3257.33   There is currently a situation that we would not have foreseen twenty years ago. We make comparisons between the United States with their universal surveillance and East Germany at the time of Stasi, where there was the same thing. And it is one of the great indications that since September 11,
3257.33-3284.50   We really saw a big change in the United States. We would not have foreseen this universal surveillance. And that was a result of what we call the Continuity of Government Arrangements, which had been planned during
3284.50-3311.44   20 years by a group of people in the government and outside. The most interesting thing is that two of these people who planned were Donald Rumsfeld and Richard Cheney, who were in power in Washington on September 11. President Bush was in Florida.
3311.44-3338.16   And these two people started implementing the provisions of continuity of government, and we can summarize them in three categories. First, universal surveillance without the mandate of a court.
3338.16-3365.25   And secondly, which was much worse, I think, indefinite detention without a court mandate. And thirdly, the permanent intervention of the army, of the military in the domestic security of the United States.
3365.25-3386.74   Points 2 and 3 were against existing laws, even, we could say, against the Constitution of the United States. We really have to explain to the French authorities that the idea of detention
3386.74-3415.38   without an undefined mandate, it contradicts one of the deepest and most traditional freedoms of Anglo-Saxon tradition. It was given by Magna Carta in 1215, and since then we have had what is called habeas corpus.
3415.38-3439.60   which says that if someone is detained in 24, 48 hours, but soon, the person who has been detained must be produced. And although I think it's horrible that we now have universal surveillance,
3439.60-3457.87   to find terrorists. We found maybe twenty, fifty, it depends on your definition, but certainly less than 500 terrorists in the United States.
3457.87-3479.87   everyone, permanently, all the time. And it became an excuse to control the public in general, to create a situation very, very similar to that of the novelist.
3479.87-3494.51   George Orwell, warned in his 1994 novel. He was wrong about the date, but he really warned about what we have now in the United States.
3494.51-3522.78   And also the third point, the intervention of the military in a permanent way in domestic security. There are also specifically American laws, passed as status laws, which prohibit this. And everything has changed.
3522.78-3546.66   apparently forever, at 10 a.m. on September 11, when Cheney and Rumsfeld finally implemented the provisions of continuity of government. The result is that we have the public state that continues as...
3546.66-3567.34   but we now have a second state, a secret state, or as we are starting to say more and more, a deep state, which is not governed by the Supreme Court, which makes its own laws.
3567.34-3592.35   There are now very technical questions where I will not get into these problems in this speech, but it is not only myself who speaks of a deep state now in the United States, and even people, academicians who speak that there was a cost.
3592.35-3621.55   a coup d'état le 11 septembre parce que c'est un tel changement de la condition politique du pays. C'est vrai qu'il faut faire des... reconnaître des similitudes avec la situation dans l'Allemagne de l'Est et pour un pays comme l'Amérique qui était...
3621.81-3650.02   who was born in conditions of revolution against an absolutist government in London who did not listen to the local authorities. It's really dramatic to see the change we've seen in this country. It's very sad. It's sad. But it's sad
3650.02-3666.59   But one should not think that the public is dead, that the public has forgotten the idea of freedom. It is very difficult to generalize.
3666.59-3692.56   of the conditions of the United States. And the moment we think, when we understand what is happening in the United States, is the moment when a new movement appears elsewhere that we did not expect. And that's why I have no faith that the government will correct the current conditions.
3692.56-3708.98   but I'm really confident that there will finally be a change that will come from the public, from people like me and my friends in the anti-war movement.
3715.12-3743.60   Guys like Cahuzac, there are not many of them, this kind of incredible appeal with which, in everyone's eyes, he said, I'm not lying, you can believe me, etc. There was something. How can you imagine that a politician will be able to say, no, no, wait a minute, the general interest is the defense of fundamental freedom, fundamental freedom is the defense of private life, and there is a conflict, it's impossible. To call hackers, in France, the problem is that the word hacker is...
3743.60-3753.26   and demonized, we simply forget that these are people who prefer results over methods and who are able to gain an intimate knowledge of a system.
