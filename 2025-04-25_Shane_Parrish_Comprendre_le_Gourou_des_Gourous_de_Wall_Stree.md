0000.00-0019.07   Shen Parrish, nice to meet you.
0019.07-0045.78   Nice to meet you. We are blessed to receive you in our show, Think Your View. We are an internet channel, and we are in life. Could you introduce yourself shortly, briefly? My name is Shane Parrish. I run a podcast called The Knowledge Project. I wrote a book called Clear Thinking, and I run a company called Cyrus Partners that makes investments in other businesses. How many books have you sold?
0045.78-0072.96   I think we're over 300,000 now worldwide. Over 300,000. How many guys you've got on your community, on your YouTube channel? Oh, subscribers too. We have almost a million people on our newsletter. I think it's 850,000 now. Our podcast is about 100,000 audio, a little bit over that.
0072.96-0097.15   I've co-authored four books and authored one book, which have reached 300,000 people. And then, what's the other? The YouTube is above 400,000 people, 350,000 people. Before that? Before that, I worked for one of our three-letter intelligence agencies in Canada. There is no three-letter agency in Canada. There is.
0097.15-0127.06   Which letter? There's only one three-letter agency in Canada, so I'm not allowed to repeat it. The American one? Well, so the American one. The American version of what I did is NSA. From inside or outside? Well, I worked at NSA for a little bit on sort of working with them, but I worked from the outside. Did you receive any training to endorse this kind of interrogation, of questioning? Wouldn't you like to know?
0129.81-0153.87   So what about the topic of your books? Which people do you provide your advices? I think most of the people who read my books work in finance or professional sports or Silicon Valley. There's a lot of people where they have a lot of leverage in their decisions. And this is what I think distinguishes our audience in a lot of ways is people who...
0153.87-0171.28   are highly ambitious or want to get ahead and want to get an edge but also people who make decisions where a small difference in your ability to make a decision can have a massive impact whether it's either through professional sports and you win the championship or it's
0171.28-0200.37   Wall Street, where you make a good trade and that trade is leveraged in the sense that you're making billions of dollars. Or Silicon Valley, where a little bit of a difference in being slightly better or making a slightly better product or better decisions on priority with product can make the difference between winning and losing or raising another round at a higher valuation or not raising another round and going out of business. And I think we naturally attract that type of audience. We're not trying to typically take people from a
0200.37-0217.01   you know, a level 10 and move them to a level 20. We're more trying to take people from level 85 and move them to like 86 or something. What kind of advice do you provide to them? I think at the core of what we...
0217.04-0244.43   talk about a lot is that there's always something you can do to improve your situation and so a lot of people don't feel that they have any agency or control over what they're doing or what's happening in the world and they feel overwhelmed and they feel like there's nothing they can do about it and these things range from small things to big things and I think what I advocate and I advocate to my children who are 14 and 15
0244.43-0257.28   is that there's always one action that you can take today that'll put you in a better place tomorrow, a better situation tomorrow. Yeah, but what is the goal for the Wall Street trader? It's just making billions?
0257.28-0287.15   Well, I'm not specifically trying to help anybody make billions, so I can't speak to the motivations of people. I think that attracts a type of person that wants to be better at their craft, and that manifests itself in sort of making money. I can't speak to their motivations internally about what they're thinking or feeling about the money. It's just the leverage of those decisions where they're making one decision, but the impact is spread over such a wide area. How much for that?
0287.34-0316.72   It's I don't know 30 bucks for the book. You can go buy it like it's it's available to anybody Okay, so my question is when you provide this kind of advice is to maximize the performance or to maximize the goal What is your attic? What is my? ethics ethics your ethics if if you provide a hammer you can build a house or you can
0316.72-0335.25   Well, it's an interesting question, right? Is the person... Let me finish. Have you ever thought about providing razor blade to monkeys? No, you know, I...
0335.41-0359.73   I don't think about it that way. I think people are going to use any information in a way that they're predisposed to use it. I don't know if we're going to change human nature. And we're giving people better tools to make better decisions. But a lot of what we talk about applies all across the board. It talks about being a better partner to your partner at home. It talks about being a better parent to your kids at home.
0359.73-0388.21   and it talks about less predicting the future and more positioning yourself for multiple possible futures if you choose to read that book and just take certain parts away that add leverage to one area or one particular aspect that's not for me to judge what you're doing with that information that's that's up to you but i hope that to find that information you've come across a whole bunch of other stuff that has broadened your world view and
0388.21-0416.48   and maybe helped you very slightly be a better partner or father. I'm a much better father because of this. I use concepts from the book with my kids. I'll give you one example if I can. Have you ever made a therapy? I have been in therapy. How long? Well, I've been in twice. I did marriage counseling before my marriage broke up, and then I did this intensive therapy last summer where a therapist came to me and we spent...
0416.48-0432.66   10 hours a day together for five days. Without or with drugs? No drugs. Have you ever tried? No. Nothing? Well, I had a cigarette once when I was 13. No, I haven't had anything illegal, no. Ever.
0432.69-0456.14   Nice. So as a Canadian, the New York Times... Wait, does that make me boring to people listening to this? No, not at all. If I continue to speak, it means that you are very interesting for me. So if I stop speaking, I shut down the canal and the show, and we're going to take some beer. So if I continue to speak, it's okay. So don't disturb me.
0456.14-0483.90   It's your former intelligence experience that you're trying to make on me. It doesn't work. You're starting to like me, I think. Be careful. I don't like anyone. Question. The Wall Street Journal or the New York Times provide to you a nickname. What is it? It's the guru of the guru of the Wall Street. Yeah, the former Canadian spy who helps Wall Street think better.
0483.90-0512.90   That would be the title, I believe, of a New York Times article by Landon Thomas, if I remember correctly. You received like what? It pleased you? I received what? The nickname from them. From them, yes. The guru. Did it please you? No. It was actually, I didn't want the article published at all, and I tried to have them not publish it. And what was their reaction?
0512.90-0537.89   Well, they're going to do whatever they want to do. Journalists. Yeah, journalists. They're free. They're supposed to be free. I didn't want my kids reading that. I didn't want them on Google Your Dad Day at work coming across this. I didn't want all the attention that that would bring to me. And I didn't want the attention that it would bring to my former employer because I thought it was sort of framed in a way that, well, the article was...
0537.89-0563.33   somewhat balanced. It just didn't serve a big purpose. Where did they get that? Did they dig on your past? Did they receive some information? Some leaks? So my recollection is they had a lot of information on me and Landon had done a lot of research and knew specific things about me and specific things that I had worked on that were classified and he shared some of that with me.
0563.33-0593.26   I was not pleased about that being published and I didn't think that there was a journalistic value to it, but I can't stop it. So, I mean, that is. And he said, why don't you come in for a conversation and we'll see where it goes. And so I ended up going in to New York to have a conversation with him. And he ended up writing, I think, what would have been what turned out to be a better article, even though I still did not want the article written. But my past life, you know, I used to do things that.
0593.58-0599.54   I don't think attaching me to is productive going forward.
0600.43-0629.62   Can you dig much more on it? No, I mean, like, it's just, it's not what I did. I worked for an intelligence agency. I have no problem admitting that. I worked for my government. To protect your country. To protect my country, to protect your country, to protect a whole bunch of different allied countries. From the Five Eyes? Well, from the Five Eyes, but sort of we partner with everybody on occasion for different reasons. You've been a data analyst or something like that?
0629.62-0645.28   I had a computer science background, so I'll leave it at that. And I think that the details of what I was doing, the techniques about what I was doing, are not relevant. What we do as a...
0645.28-0659.78   community is different so maybe i'll relate this to snowden right so let's think about edward snowden and his document release it was my next question oh okay perfect and maybe chelsea mannings too in the same package okay so you have these people who are revealing
0659.78-0680.32   what your government is doing and how your government is doing that. And so I think my nuanced take on this is what your government is up to in a democracy should be known, and it shouldn't have surprised anybody about what was happening on their behalf. The techniques around which
0680.32-0696.34   people were using to accomplish that have no business being published and that is a threat to lives, it's a threat to intelligence agencies, it's a threat to security all over the world. Chelsea.
0696.62-0723.79   I mean, it's the same nuance, right? Like the document release put a lot of people in jeopardy. It cost a lot of money in tradecraft. To say that it didn't lose lives, I don't know the correct answer to that, but I would have a hard time believing that some sources were not. I'm going to provide the mic to one of my friends. I think we're going to continue this very interesting answer. Okay. About Chelsea Manning? Yes.
0725.49-0747.50   So they might have compromised a few things, but they revealed, both of them, including Assange, to the world what was really going on. And it did surprise lots of people. Probably not people like us, but it did surprise lots of people that the United States could behave like this, especially toward allies.
0748.05-0776.82   And especially to France, because most of our president, if not all our president, have been under scrutiny from the American Secret Service. Right now, thanks to Donald Trump, the French are realizing that the U.S. might not be such a good ally, but so far hasn't been a problem. How can you explain this? Because we have the information we have for 12 years, at least, if we count from Snowden.
0776.94-0804.24   How did we become so naive or so stupid as French? I don't think I have a good answer to that. As an analyst, how do you analyze that? If you had to write a report to... As a private citizen, not as an analyst.
0804.94-0832.85   in my current, I would think about it through different lenses. One of those lenses would be, I would expect that each country is out for themselves. And then I would expect them to form partnerships that are sort of loosely formed. And loosely formed partnerships sort of evolve almost like friendships in teenagers. You go through phases where you're best friends, you go through phases where you're fighting, you go through phases where...
0833.39-0849.68   You hope to get to a better place and I think that you're sort of always keeping tabs on the other person But not necessarily in a nefarious way but always for the better interest of your country and your people and I would also suspect and I know
0849.68-0873.39   as a private citizen, that all countries are doing this. And just because one country was revealed to have been doing this, I don't think that it's wise to believe that other countries are not engaged in it. Some are just way better at it than others. So in this, I like the terms teenage friendship, work with the US, France and the US are kind of a...
0873.39-0902.37   Rough situation. Well, rough for the moment, right? And the same as Canada. The U.S. and Canada, the tensions right now are pretty high. But it doesn't change the fact that after September 11th, we're the first people down there helping them. It doesn't change the fact that there's California wildfires. We're not getting along. We're still the first people there. Because at the end of the day, we're best friends. We might be fighting now, but we share one of the longest undefended borders in the world.
0902.37-0915.79   And for us to get along with them and them to get along with us is, I think, you know, I don't want to take it for granted, but I do tend to think this is just a phase and we'll get to a better relationship on the other side of it.
0915.98-0942.93   But there is a big problem concerning free speech between the United States and most of its allies. I mean, whether it's Canada or Europe, there is a huge cultural gap going on. And it's becoming a major problem since most of the social networks where the free speech happens are American and depends on the United States of America to be censored or not to be censored.
0943.18-0959.54   I mean, the U.S. was going down the same path that the rest of the world seemed to be going down. And then Donald Trump was elected as the president of the United States. And it seems to have taken a sharp turn towards more free speech.
0959.54-0976.56   think my personal belief is that that's a good thing for the world and that free speech is the bedrock to democracy and compromising free speech whether you do it through media whether you do it through controlled media whether you do it through
0976.72-0999.07   regulating conspiracy theories or subsidies to newspapers. I don't think that you can actually have accountability for a government if the media is largely funded by the government. And I do think you need free speech because that's going to allow independent...
0999.07-1023.81   media, in this case, like a lot of media is state-funded. And when I say state-funded, I mean the government is one of the largest subscription customers to a lot of newspapers. The local government in France, it's the local government. It's the same as in Canada. There's also subsidies for journalism. So there's grants that are given to these companies that subsidize journalistic salaries. There's advertising that's placed in the, I don't know if it's the same in France, but in Canada.
1023.81-1042.19   The government writ large, whether you consider it the provincial or federal government, is a large advertiser in newspapers. And so newspapers are hesitant to lose these as their clients. So you can see that through slanted coverage. It's just slightly slanted, right? Like it's not super obvious in all cases.
1042.19-1071.50   However, an interesting experiment one of your readers could do in France or any other country is just to ask AI to go through all the articles and all the newspapers and all the journalism over the past one year. And is it favorable? Is it non-favorable? And how biased is it? And make a determination of how biased it is. And I think people will be surprised by that. So going back to free speech, the reason that free speech is important is if your media is no longer able to function the traditional role that
1071.50-1092.30   have played in a democracy, then you need other media. And we live in a world where you can reach a million people, I can reach a million people, where somebody posting something on X can reach a million people. And so when you get into the notion of regulating conspiracy theories, which a lot of these governments are going down that path.
1092.30-1120.72   including one of our candidates in Canada, it really scares me because that means, like, think of COVID, right? The Wuhan lab thing, which has largely come out to be true, but at the time it was a conspiracy theory. So you would have prevented that knowledge from even existing in the world and penalized and probably jailed or otherwise attacked the people saying that. And you would only have controlled media giving information to people. And I think that that is the beginning of the end, if not...
1120.72-1141.28   the second, third, fourth inning of the end of democracy. Do you think that between what happened during COVID with this mass censorship and informational nonsense all over the place and AI coming into the playing game, the playing field of media?
1141.28-1166.03   where more and more people are asking Grok or OpenAI or Perplexity about current event, about what should I think about this topic, how should I think about this topic, which is basically what you teach high-end Wall Street trader to do. Do you think this is going to affect media, journalism, and how is it going to affect this?
1166.03-1185.06   Well, let's think about this, right? So if we think out loud about this, I think most of the people getting their news from Main Street media are probably, at least in Canada, and I would imagine this generalizes around the world, they're 55 plus. So the people reading physical newspapers, getting from legacy sort of media are older.
1185.06-1205.60   And those people, by and large, are going to become fewer and fewer as we go forward the next 20 years. And more people are going to be younger and more technology, sort of tech first for media, whether they get it on X or they get it from Grok or OpenAI. And so if you were to form a hypothesis around controlling what people see.
1205.60-1229.47   and biasing a population in favor of a political party or just suppressing, the way to do that would be to go after conspiracy theories because the minute you get conspiracy theories, you can now go after AI and you can go after what AI presents to people in that country. And the minute that you can do that, you've effectively moved from one traditional slanted, slightly...
1229.47-1254.16   You know, if you were to go to the extreme, it's controlled media to another form of controlled media. And I think that one of the hopes that I have is that AI gets us out of that and we can have free speech through AI. And that gives people better information, whether that information is nuanced and detailed for them and specifically tailored to them, or it's just a broad set of information that's available. And I think that that would be key to people.
1255.31-1282.61   I'm going to speak in French and my friend is going to speak in English to translate to you, okay? So you're going to be the translator, my friend. Regarding COVID, you said that the state has put journalists and media under the control of information. Will you translate the first part? About COVID, you told us that media have been under control of governments.
1284.21-1311.12   But did you put yourself in the suit of the government who might have seen COVID as something coming from China and militarized?
1312.56-1339.95   And if it was a militarized operation, it was kind of logic to have a severe tight on the press and media and severe control of the media. What is your point of view about that? Why? I don't know if I agree with that. In an extreme situation, maybe sometimes the government needs to be strong. I don't.
1340.46-1367.41   I don't know if I fundamentally agree with that in the sense that I don't think that even in an extreme situation, if you have trust in your government, the government can come out and say, I don't know, but here's our best recommendation and give you competing information. And that competing information then you can take. And part of what we're trying to teach people is judgment and decision making and critical thinking. So you can take that information and then make your own decisions.
1367.41-1393.34   Unfortunately, I was forced in Canada to take that information and make my own decisions, which contravened law, right? Like I ran a homeschool for my kids, and you weren't allowed to do that, and you weren't allowed to do a whole bunch of other things that we ended up doing, but we knew full well the regulations. We just opted out of them at the time. And I think that we lose trust, especially in our institutions, when the institutions control information.
1393.34-1418.67   And then the information that they have released proves to be wrong in hindsight. So if there was another COVID today, I think it would be a much different situation where most people, and rightfully so, I think most people would not be trusting of government recommendations. And I think that this is the lack of, when you have that control, the byproduct is you create the situation where you just basically get to less and less trust going forward.
1419.25-1438.83   So what kind of advices or what kind of technique that you can teach to government to avoid that? What kind of advices you can provide to them to improve trust between them and the population? Well, it's interesting because...
1438.90-1467.68   I worked for an intelligence agency, and the number one thing that matters at an intelligence agency is trust. The public trusts you because they can't see what you're doing, and they often can't see how you're doing it. And nothing is more important than that trust. And if the lens through which government should look at things, at least one of the top two or three is, is this going to erode trust in citizens' view of the government? And in the current context, in the current crisis,
1467.68-1492.56   that might not have a huge impact. But on the next crisis, on the next event, it slowly erodes to the point where, like, again, if we had another sort of COVID event today, I think the vast majority of people in general would be slightly more skeptical than they would have been before. And so we had one shot, we wasted it, and we haven't come out and corrected it. And the way to come out and correct it is like...
1492.56-1519.25   We were wrong. We made these assumptions. We were trying to protect you. We were trying to do these things. And based on the information we had and have a full audit of that information available to people in a very transparent way. And if you can do that, then you can start to establish a baseline again where you can start to rebuild trust. But my friend has this concept of the trust battery where you sort of like you start at 50% or I think he starts at like 70 and you either go forward or backwards based on there.
1519.25-1549.07   And I think we've just gone backwards too long. And one of the ways to get us to move forward is not only to allow free speech, but to have a government that talks to its people like we're adults instead of kids. So we're not telling us what to do as much as helping us understand the various nuances of the situation. Have you read Peter Thiel's article in the Financial Times named Time for Trust and Reconciliation?
1549.07-1577.70   No. He basically advocates for something that is quite WikiLeaks-like, which is release all the documents about big affairs, whether it's 9-11 or JFK, MLK, everything. And he states that if we release everything in a transparent way, we will rebuild trust and we will get rid of all this conspiracy theory nonsense.
1577.70-1607.44   What do you think about that? Well, I think that the flaw of that argument is that you're trusting them to release everything. And how will you know if they have released everything? So I think that that sort of argument becomes a little suspicious in the sense of if they were to literally take everything and give public access to everything. Again, going back to Snowden, I'm in favor of people.
1607.44-1618.24   knowing what their governments are doing in a democratic government that is elected by the citizens. The citizens have a right to know generally speaking what their government is doing on their behalf.
1618.24-1645.82   I don't think it translates into specific techniques. So if you were to release the techniques, I think that has a hugely negative consequence. And so in that way, I guess I'm in favor of some sort of withholding of information from citizens. And I think we'd have complete chaos if we released everything all the time. Not only that, worldwide, it would be very destructive, especially when it comes to...
1645.82-1650.72   software vulnerabilities or something like that that might affect a lot of systems.
1650.72-1678.72   all the back doors that the NSA provide everywhere. Well, there's this innate tension in any country that has sort of an intelligence agency that's designed to acquire information and at the same time protect information. And how do you balance this tension between we're supposed to acquire information for our citizens and our protection and then at the same time defend other people who are actively trying to steal it?
1678.72-1697.55   take that information. And it is super interesting to think about these two competing roles that a lot of organizations play. And the choices become how do we use this? Do we sort of use this to acquire information that might save?
1697.55-1723.76   troops in theater or do we use this to protect people at home and protect our systems and can we do both and then at what cost do we reveal that to our allies do we not reveal it to our allies and these are the decisions that that go into some of this stuff what is your point of view about cryptography i don't know anything about it you don't know anything about that no it's not involved no what do you think about the fact that
1725.30-1753.81   Government try to remove the capability to people to send messages without the capability of the government to size it. Wait, what was this? Basically, we have a coming law that is really hard to pass, but it could pass either on the French level or European level, asking for mandatory backdoors for every messaging system, whether it's signal.
1753.81-1777.33   Telegram, WhatsApp. It's just so naive because if you have a backdoor in a system, to think that you control that backdoor and nobody else can access it is just such flawed thinking. Only we can access that backdoor. That means that only we can protect this information. I don't believe that. How do you analyze the fact that the governments try to culpabilize you?
1777.39-1785.49   Because you are protecting the terrorists. You are protecting the drug dealers with this kind of instrument.
1785.81-1812.21   It's like propaganda. It's an argument that's hard to argue against because of the way that it's framed. But the framing is incorrect in the sense that there's multiple solutions to these problems, not just one solution. And a solution that weakens privacy rights for people. I'm a strong advocate of privacy rights. So I think a solution that weakens that needs to be the solution of absolute last resort.
1812.21-1841.65   And I don't think we're anywhere near that stage. And the tools available to governments to do this. What kind of advice can you provide to diplomats to improve peace, talk, and solving problems of our century? I have a lot of hope. Do you believe in God? I believe in something. I'm not quite sure if it's a god or...
1841.81-1847.14   I have a lot of hope and my hope comes from technology and my hope comes from
1847.14-1872.83   realizing you know we go through like the teenage relationship thing where you go through these fights with your friends and then you end up you know they're the best man at your wedding and you have to go through these periods because they make you stronger and these periods also help us realize that our relationships are important again and often especially with governments I think we can it's so easy to take these friendships for granted
1872.83-1897.50   And we forget that we are a partner in this and we have to. The best way to be a good partner is to be a deserving partner. And I think that often we're in it like what's in it for us. And we're not thinking about it the same way you think about your marriage, which is how do I make your life better? And how do I make me as a better partner for you? And how do we work together as a partnership and as a team?
1897.50-1921.95   And I think that it's so easy for us to go through that phase and then come to a phase where a lot of people come to in their marriages too, where you just, you take advantage of that person and you don't do it consciously. It's not like you're trying to take advantage of them. You just take them for granted. And then in that moment, you've fractured your relationship and then you have to repair it. And I like to think that around the world, we're in this stage of...
1921.95-1951.28   We're maybe in a fractured relationship, but when we repair it, it'll be stronger than it was before. But we're going to have to go through this phase where it might be rough for everybody for a little while. But at the end of the day, I think that we're going to get back to the same, if not better place than we were before. And then I'm optimistic for technology for just solving a lot of these problems that we have in the world, including governments thinking better and thinking through things.
1951.47-1977.92   You know, it would be interesting to see I don't I'm not advocating this but it'd be interesting to see an AI run for a government seat as an elected body and what a Parallel what that would do like if I ran a newspaper I would run a column on this where you have all these readings of bills in Parliament or the government and I would have AI give me its take on the bill given the situation going on in the world, so I have a
1977.92-2002.03   hopefully less biased take on this, but a well thought out, well nuanced take. And I like, you know, I don't agree with everything, how Elon's going about it. But one of the things that I'm appreciative with Doge is that they're trying to cut the bill sizes to a readable length. And so you can't just shove in a thousand pages of all these like.
2002.26-2016.82   Pork barrel sort of like funding that go along with the main bill and I also think the framing of these bills should be different You know, we frame these bills like the Patriot Act. So going back to framing framing framing defines how we think about a problem. So
2016.82-2041.31   If the Patriot Act could have included something completely absurd and no privacy for anybody, and it would be like you voted against the Patriot Act. And so, so often we get all of our substance and all of our knowledge from the headlines and then the framing, the names that we label things, make it really hard for us to disagree with them, going back to the privacy thing. It's framed in such a way that you're for.
2041.31-2064.45   these uh no i'm not for these terrorists this is this oh you are against us exactly and that that framing is divisive and so that framing is also a way to fracture society because then it's the people who agree with this or disagree with this are not like us they're different than us and they're less than us and i don't think that that is the way to
2064.45-2088.64   think about those things. And I think, you know, we had this in Canada with these truckers who came. It was worldwide news. I'm sure it made it here, too. And they came downtown and they sort of camped out and they were, by and large, having fun and very disruptive to people, to businesses. At the same time, you know, our government labeled them as something that they were not. And it really divided society.
2088.64-2113.14   You know, they used the emergency clause. And I think the court, the Supreme Court, if I recall correctly, found that they were not within their right of using that. So government overreached on their powers. And I don't believe that there's been any consequences to that. This kind of stuff happened in most Western democracy these last five years. Are we drowning as democracies?
2114.03-2135.41   I think we pushed too far to one side. And so democracies, in my understanding, have naturally worked oscillating between slightly left and slightly right. And there's sort of like a medium that we sort of spend most of our time in, if that makes sense. And I think the last...
2136.27-2150.53   15 years maybe we've really just started to go a lot more extreme left and extreme right and both of those things have consequences and both of those things are not
2150.53-2179.42   In my mind, I'm more of a moderate, I guess, so maybe my bias is coming at this through a moderate lens, where I'm not extreme left, I'm not extreme right. And I think that I voted for multiple political parties in my life, depending on the issues that we're facing as a country. Maybe you've been fooled multiple times. Maybe. I like to believe in the best of people, though, because at the end of the day, if you can't believe, you have no hope for the future.
2179.42-2207.73   I was talking to somebody the other day and they said, you know, I go, oh, I go visit these companies. I forget the guy's name, from Green Oaks. And I wasn't, I was listening to it, but he was talking with Patrick O'Shaughnessy. It was a podcast. I forget his name. It's Matt something. And he was talking about one of the ways that they assess a company is that it's very intangible, but it's like, do people believe the best days are ahead of it or behind it?
2207.86-2234.62   And I thought that that was an interesting sort of variable on which to look at a spectrum of things. And I think that countries should also think that way. Our citizens should have hope for the future, that our best days are ahead of us. And I think one of the things that has fallen behind, at least I can only speak to Canada, is that equality of opportunity has changed a lot. And the people that are being born today...
2234.62-2251.22   are facing a lot different opportunities than their grandparents had. And so in two generations, we've sort of gone in a direction where people are losing hope quickly. And I think that part of what... They are losing hope quickly.
2252.34-2274.16   If you are working multiple jobs and you can't afford to put food on your table, and you're being told no all the time by the government when you might have a divergent view, and you're being taxed at the wazoo for working extra, I think that that...
2274.16-2294.75   just inevitably, no matter how strong-minded you are, eventually that wears on you. And then what do you do in those cases? You see rising crime. And rising crime, in my mind, I'd be interested if somebody can verify this, is tied to opportunity. And so if you feel like you have no opportunity,
2294.75-2322.26   then you might as well turn to a life of crime. But if you feel you have an opportunity and you feel the system is fair and you feel you can make a difference and you feel that hard work can make a great living, then it becomes illogical to turn to crime. And I think that people unconsciously feel that. And that's why we see crime rise when we see a generational divide. And we were talking about this a little earlier. You're seeing a little bit of this in France, too.
2322.26-2333.71   We're definitely seeing it in Canada where younger people are feeling like their opportunity set is very different than their grandparents. It was very deep what you said.
2333.71-2363.01   You impressed me. In the beginning, I thought that you were just another empty shell from the Silicon Valley, but you are more stronger than I expected and I thought. What kind of advice can you provide to people who are supposed to regulate conspiracy terrorists? What kind of advice do you have to provide to them? Because in France, some of them...
2363.01-2381.26   call them the junkie of the stupidity or the conspiracy theorist. The conspiracy theorists are the... It's a kind of opium for stupids. Do you think this is the right way to talk to them?
2381.30-2408.62   No, I don't think that's the right way to talk to anybody who believes something different than you believe. And I don't think government should be regulating conspiracy theories. And so I just don't think that should exist. And I think where we go with this is if we educate our citizens properly through school and they grow up in our country, they should be able to come out of high school, especially university, but definitely high school too.
2408.62-2433.07   being able to think through these things for themselves. And if they're not capable at 17 to sort of look at information online and form a reasonable judgment, and that judgment may or may not agree with our personal take on things, but they should be able to form a judgment based on that. And if that judgment is different than ours, that's okay. And if that judgment, you know...
2433.07-2461.22   I'm not going to say it should be weighted equally to everybody else's opinion if we're sort of like trying to come to a solution to something. But I don't think that labeling people who think differently than us anything is helpful. And it just gets everybody's back up and it makes it harder to change our minds because once somebody labels us as stupid or anything like that, what do we do? How many times have you ever been like, oh, you know what? You're right.
2461.22-2479.33   I am being stupid. That never happens. It rarely happens in your closest friendships. When your best friend comes to you and tells you you're doing something that is silly or stupid, it's definitely not going to happen when your government comes to you and says that. And so I think we need to let...
2479.33-2506.77   We need to develop people who are capable of thinking through information and we need to provide people multiple sources of information and have people come to their own conclusions. The flip side of this is the problem is you can't be an expert at everything. So on some things you need to pick and choose. Where am I going to go deep and where am I going to get close to the source and where am I going to have real knowledge versus where am I going to have surface knowledge? And a lot of, if you think of like...
2507.76-2532.08   I'll come back to this in a second. So a lot of the information we consume is just surface knowledge. It's been filtered three or four times by somebody else. And so I have this idea called the learning loop. And the learning loop is how we actually learn. And so if you imagine a clock, you start at the 12 hand. And at the 12 hand, you have an experience. That experience can be reading a book. It can be having a conversation. It can be reading an article. And then you have...
2532.08-2554.80   At the three-hand, you have reflection. And reflection is taking this information, this massive quantity of information. The higher quality, the better. But we take this quantity of information and then we distill it. So at the six-hand, you have this compression. And the compression is the distillation of that experience for us. And it might be one sentence and it might be two sentences, but it's sort of like a little distillation.
2554.80-2584.11   And then at the nine hand, you have an action. So this is the loop. The action feeds the experience. So you take information like a big movie. You basically compress it into something smaller and more manageable and easy to transfer around in your head. Then you use that information. Now, that is information you've earned. So you've done the work. You've done the reading. You're constantly updating it. And you're using that information and applying it. So it's still hard, but it's easier for you to be an expert in that area.
2584.30-2601.20   On the other hand, most of the information we consume is somebody's abstractions. We're consuming the compression. We're not consuming the experience and the reflection. So we have no idea what the raw data is. We have no idea how people thought about it or how they shrunk it.
2601.20-2627.46   And so we just have the sound bite almost of information. And that information is generally correct, but not always correct. And we don't know when it's which. That's the problem. So like a great example of this is I can go home tonight and I can pull out a recipe book and I can make that recipe. And if I make that recipe perfectly, you're not going to be able to tell the difference between me and the chef who created that recipe.
2627.46-2642.90   But the minute something is off in that recipe, the minute like something just doesn't come out quite right. And I have no idea why, because I followed the recipe. I should have like, I don't know what happened. I don't know. But the chef would instantly taste that food.
2642.90-2667.76   And with that taste, they would know your oven is not the right temperature. It might say 300 degrees, but it was actually 250. Your thermometer's not working. There wasn't enough salt. You stirred it the wrong way. You didn't stir it enough. You let it boil when it shouldn't have boiled. They knew exactly. And why do they know? Because they have that earned knowledge. So I think one of the keys for people, whatever your theories are, whatever your beliefs are, is just to have a check and balance on that, which is...
2667.76-2685.89   Do I actually have the earned knowledge here? Am I deep enough? Can I argue the other side of this argument? Can I trust the other side? Can I trust the information I'm receiving? Those are key questions. And I think in the vast majority of cases, the answer is, I might hold this opinion, but I'm going to hold it loosely.
2685.89-2710.51   And I'm not going to hold it tightly. And loosely means I'm open to changing my mind because I realize I'm not an expert in this. I don't have all the information and I'm missing key pieces of information. If you think about decision making, the source of all problems in decision making is blind spots. We don't see something. So if we're playing poker and sort of the five of us are sitting down at a poker table and I can see all of your hands.
2710.51-2717.44   How many mistakes am I going to make? And the answer is I'm not going to make any. I'm going to play my hands perfectly. It doesn't mean I'm going to win.
2717.44-2747.41   but it means I'm going to play my hand perfectly. And I think a lot of the problems that we have with decisions are that we just have these blind spots, whether we can't relate to somebody else. Once we've identified them as different than us, we have no desire to see the world through their eyes because now all of a sudden they're different. And I want to see the world through other people's eyes because I want to see what I'm missing. And it doesn't mean I have to agree with you, but when I'm interviewing people on the Knowledge Project, my goal is I want to see what you see, I want to smell what you smell, and I want to think what you think. That doesn't mean I agree with you.
2747.41-2773.34   But I want to see the world through your eyes because that allows me a different lens into the situation so that I can walk away knowing more than I did before. And I don't agree with, you know, a lot of our guests on some of their takes. And I think it's just really important to be open minded enough to be like, I don't this person is an expert at what they do. Like, I want to see why they think that or see why they feel that. Before coming here, did you dug on us?
2773.34-2795.18   I did a little bit of research, yeah. With your previous past? No, I mean, I try not to overthink this stuff because I don't enjoy being interviewed. I enjoy doing the interview. So if I overthink it too much, it can kind of backfire with me because then I much prefer asking questions and not being the center of attention.
2795.18-2820.05   That's why I just have 45 minutes to make the interview. You're afraid? You plan a dinner after us? That's why you can escape? No, I was given, I mean, the time that I have on my feet. I will escape my world now. Okay, so I use AI to invoke Charles Bukowski, a poet. So I use Grok.
2820.34-2849.54   To shape some question from Charles Bukowski. Okay. The first one, Shane, you never punched a wall or a man just to feel something real. Are you one of those soft type who thinks paints just a metaphor? I have never punched something to feel something real. I have punched people in self-defense.
2849.54-2875.70   or when I felt threatened. So I guess that makes me a pussy. Did you want? Yes. You've got a huge ego or not? No. How did you polish your ego? Polished, sorry. You polished your ego with what? Experiences? Pain? Books?
2876.18-2902.32   That's a good question. Pain, mostly. Failure, constantly trying new things and being in public doing it. You're constantly exposed to, I don't know, sensitive is the wrong word, but I'm constantly exposed to feedback from people on what we're doing.
2902.35-2930.54   I think that that just keeps me in check. And my mom also does a really good job of, you know, we reached, I think, 750,000 readers on our newsletter. I sent her an email and I was like, oh, this is cool. And she's like, that's not even the population of your city, right? Like it was just sort of her way of being a loving mother, but at the same time keeping me small. And my kids do a good job of that too. And it makes you...
2930.90-2943.31   in pain that your mother tried to keep you small? No, I think the pain comes from, you know, I was a misfit as a kid, a straight D student and nobody...
2943.47-2972.88   very few people believed in me or gave me a chance and I think that that puts a chip on people's shoulder that gives them a fire that either that fire can destroy them or in my case it can motivate you but it also keeps you proving things even though you've long proven yourself if that makes sense you don't actually internalize it so it has this doesn't have an off switch and that can be a bad thing I still have five minutes yeah but can I
2972.88-2995.60   Can I hope 10? I guess, yeah. But just keep it quickly. Okay, okay. So the other question from the grave. What's the last lie you told to yourself? To get through the night and don't bullshit me with some fairy tales about hope.
2996.27-3012.69   I'm going to repeat it. What's the last lie you told yourself to get through the night and don't bullish me or bullshit me, bullshit me, with some fairy tales about hope? Hope.
3013.90-3038.19   With an H. Yeah, thank you. I speak English like a Spanish cow today. Je parle français comme une vache espagnole. Perfect. So what was the last lie you told yourself to get through the night and don't bullshit me with some fairy tales about hope? During COVID, that was probably the most stressful time in my life.
3038.80-3054.99   And I would go to bed basically crying at one point every night because there was no hope. And the world wasn't changing and the world wasn't coming back and the world disagreed with me.
3055.22-3083.15   I was taking care of my kids. I'm giving people context. My kids, my parents, my employees for our businesses, my friends' kids, their parents. And I'm trying to put the weight of the world on my shoulders and nobody's taking care of me. And I wasn't taking care of me. And the mindset, the lie that I told myself, if you want to call it a lie, is that
3083.54-3110.82   this is the rest of my life. The world is not going to get better. And that was the lie because I knew, rationally speaking, the world was going to get better and we were going to heal and we were going to move on. But the lie helped me because the lie made me realize that nothing is going to change, so I have to change in order to survive first and then thrive second in this environment without things changing.
3110.82-3136.59   And it changed my actions and what I was doing. And so instead of waiting for somebody to take care of me, I started taking care of myself. I started going to the gym. I started running more. I cut out alcohol. I started going to bed at the same time. And I just started making sure that I was a priority for myself. And then that enabled me to sort of get through the darkest times of that.
3136.59-3162.74   I was violating the law. We had people showing up at the house. It was just a disaster. So still pulling Charles Bukowski out from his grave, what's uglier to you, the mirror at 6 a.m. or the blank page you've been laughing at for weeks? The mirror. I hate how I look. Straight answer. If you could burn one thing, your past, your world?
3162.74-3183.28   or this whole rotten world? What is it going to be? And why are you hesitating? I'm not hesitating. I would burn the past. I mean, I definitely endeavor to keep my word at all times. Without past, you don't have future.
3183.28-3207.06   Well, with any of those questions, they're so easy to attack your answer, right? So without a past, you don't learn from your mistakes. So we still have three minutes. Could you provide me, again, the name of your book? Clear Thinking. Could you advise trios or more, not from you?
3207.54-3214.61   Three other books. I'm a big fan of Poor Charlie's Almanac, which is published by Stripe Press.
3214.61-3243.44   I'm a huge fan of another book on sort of the Buffet Munger thing called Seeking Wisdom by Peter Bevelin. And I'm a big fan of Meditations by Marcus Aurelius, which is a book that I come back to at certain moments in my life. The first time I came across that book, I think I was 17 or 18. It didn't make any sense to me. And part of it still doesn't make sense to me today, but I relate a lot more to it. And trying to, you know, here you have the most powerful men in the world.
3243.44-3263.02   And you basically at the time could do anything and there was no laws that really applied to him. And yet he's very humble and very down to earth. And this is his private journal. And there's something about that that I find not only intellectually attractive, but I just find reassuring.
3263.02-3293.02   about the fact that we can have leaders who are touching the population, that are connected to people, who are human and aren't just driven by power or ego or money, and that we can have a real person in these jobs that can make a difference for everybody and bring back sort of the best of what we can be. How do we unleash human potential? And how do we unleash society in a way that works for everybody? And I think those questions, I think we have to start asking them again.
3293.02-3312.94   so the last question who is not a question is could you provide advice to the young generation what advice to the young generation don't give up there's
3312.94-3341.63   Always something within your control today that you can do to make tomorrow better. And no matter how bleak things look when you look up, and no matter how much you think that you're not going to be able to do it, shrink the gap between where you're looking and where you want to go. And what I mean by that is think of a marathoner who's running. The marathoner does not look at the end of the race.
3341.63-3361.34   at mile three and is like, how do I get there? That's too far. The marathoner, when they hit their pain, when everything looks bleak, when they don't want to run, they don't look two miles in the future. They look at the next stop sign and they tell themselves, can I get to that stop sign?
3361.34-3385.07   And once they get to that stop sign, it's like, can I get to the next stop sign? Can I build momentum here? Maybe the next stop sign is 50 feet farther than the first one. And you start building that momentum. And that's where you can make a difference. And the way that you can make a difference is there's a stop sign in your life today. And that stop sign is what is the smallest thing that I can work on today that's going to put me in a better position tomorrow.
3385.07-3413.06   And if I can do that and I can do it again tomorrow and I can repeat this for the next six months, my life is going to be in a dramatically different position. And that small thing might be learning a new skill. It might be playing around with AI. It might be building an app. It might be getting off your butt and actually trying to do that idea that you've been telling your friends about for years. It might be writing the next great novel. But it starts with a paragraph. I mean, trying to write a novel is really hard. It starts with...
3413.06-3431.18   One sentence, and then a paragraph, and then a page, and then a chapter. And I think if you shrink the distance where you're looking, there's always something you can do right now to make things better tomorrow. Shane Parrish, thank you. A pleasure.
